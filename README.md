# TeslaClone
In this project I tried to clone small part of the tesla website and also added a few thing from my mind.
You'll see a page that contains features of tesla model s.
There are scrolling animations in the Features part.
And also there is a page for purchasing, in the purchasing page there is a 3D model that we can rotate to different directions with our mouse.
However I wont be able to share source of the Model so that part will be empty. But you can see that part in the code.
In the purchase page you can choose color for the car and if chosen color is out of stock purchase button will be unactive.
If you can complete the purchase process status of that car will be sold in the database.
MySQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Node.js used in this project.
